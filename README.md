# Room_LiveData_RecyclerView_Tutorial

ROOM persistence library + LiveData (Observer)

And a minimalist RecyclerView.

Thanks to this project you can easily understand how to use the Room persistence library and how to use LiveData and Observers and how to use the RecyclerView Android object.

Note that the RecyclerView is not linked to the Observer.
